# ZapposApp

This was an app I started making as part of an internship test for Zappos. While I was not able to finish the app due to a grad school visit interfering, it still demonstrates my Android skills and I intend to finish it at a later time.

I was given permission to put this app in a public repository; indeed, I was required to do so.
